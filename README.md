# ESE 650 Final Project: Navigation Recovery RL
------------

Reproduced 2D Navigation Experiments of Recovery RL (https://github.com/abalakrishna123/recovery-rl) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15920.pdf">Recovery RL: Safe Reinforcement Learning with Learned Recovery Zones</a>. 

Adapted Recovery RL for Image Based Navigation and 3D Quadroter Navigation.

To setup, run `. install.sh`.

To run experiments, execute the following scripts:

### Navigation 1
`. scripts/navigation1.sh`

###  Navigation 2
`. scripts/navigation2.sh`

###  Navigation 3
`. scripts/navigation3.sh`

###  Image Maze
`. scripts/image_maze.sh`

Trained policies for 3D quadroter navigation and generated sample trajectory using Recovery RL and Unconstrained RL as well as results for all experiments can be accessed via this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VfY-jBVatPug8kDOxl47_BwFkwtQeTbk/view?usp=share_link
